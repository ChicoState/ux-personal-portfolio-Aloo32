# UX Portfolio

Hi, I'm Alejandro! Originally from Sonora, I now work as a field engineer in a town called Paradise. Passionate about basketball and table tennis, I find joy in sports both for excitement and relaxation. My profession offers challenging yet rewarding experiences, where I apply creativity and precision to solve complex problems.
